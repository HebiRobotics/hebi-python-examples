"""
In this example we will implement various hybrid motion-force controllers using the impedance control plugin, which can be used for a wide variety of 
applications.
Impedance control is BEST SUITED for enabling free, rigid and springy behaviour, along/about each different axis.
While this is perfectly useful for:
- Having a selectively compliant end-effector,
- Switching between fixed and free behaviour to simulate (mostly) rigid constraints, and
- Allowing human intervention for automated operations by separating controls across different axes,
any applications involving more salient control of the forces (as more complex functions with flexible inputs) should use our force control plugin. See ex_force_control_demoname.py.

This comprises the following demos:
- Fixed: A task-space pose controller implemented entirely using force control via the (PD) impedance controller.
- Cartesian: Locks onto a particular end-effector position while having some compliant orientation.
- Gimbal: A gimbal that locks a specific end-effector orientation, while keeping the rest of the arm compliant.
- Floor: The end-effector is free to move but can't travel below a virtual floor. To further simulate sliding on the floor, see force_control example.
- Damping: The end-effector behaves as 3-different damped systems (overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped), at 3 different heights.

The following example is for the "Floor" demo:
